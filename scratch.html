			Description: In this project, I used Scratch to design and create a program that displays my name. The requirements were to add a sprite for each letter in my name and then give them three cool behaviors. The program needed to start when the green flag was clicked and for extra credit I added a function to reset the screen to the beginning each time the green flag was clicked.
		</p>
		
		<h4> Concepts Learned </h4>
		
		<ul>
			<li> Events -  I used the green flag clicked and when space key pressed event blocks to change the costumes of the letters and have the fish start moving </li>
			<li> Looks - I used the change costume betton for the letter sprites so they would change when the green flag was clicked or the space key was pressed </li>
			<li> Sprites - I used the library of sprites to find letters in my name and adjusted the costumes when the space key or green flag were pressed </li>
			<li> Control - I used a forever block to continually make the fish move until the green flag was pressed </li>
			<li> Movement - I used the x and y values to make my sprites move to their original location when the green flag was clicked and I rotated the B sprite 15 degrees forever and then straighten it after the green flag was clicked using a movement button </li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3> Computer Buying Project </h3>

			Description: In this project, I used Scratch to design and create a program that displayed my choice of computer that was perfect for an 11th grader. The requirements were to present 4 computers, and then chose the best one based on what the 11th grader needed in her/his computer. The program started when the green flag was clicked.
		</p>
		
		<h4> Concepts Learned </h4>
		
		<ul>
			<li> Events - I used the when the green flag is clicked and when the right arrow key is pressed block to go to the next slide/start the presentation </li>
			<li> Looks - I used the switch costume block and the show and hide blocks to program the sprites in the presentation to appear and disappear </li>
			<li> Sprites - I used the the library of sprites to decorate the presentation and make it look nice </li>
			<li> Control - I used a forever block on one of the sprites to make it change costumes constantly </li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3> Scratch Final Project </h3>

			Description: In this project, I used Scratch to design and create a game where the player has to make the bug dodge all the basketballs that are rolling towards it. The requirements were to let the player know they won, keep score, have a timer, have a help screen with directions, have the game reset when itâ€™s over, and have the game get harder as the player keeps playing. The program starts when the green flag is clicked.
		</p>

		<h4> Concepts Learned </h4>
		
		<ul>
			<li> Events - I used the when the green flag is clicked and when ____ key is pressed block a lot in this project so the game could start/start the tutorial/go back to the start page. I also used broadcasting a lot in my project to signal something to appear or for the game to start </li>
			<li> Looks - I used the switch costumes and the show/hide blocks to make the basketballs appear and disappear in my game. I also used the say block to notify the player that the game was starting/they lost/how to play. </li>
			<li> Sprites - I used the library of sprites to create the characters of the game and help with instructions </li>
			<li> Control - I used the forever and if blocks so that when a basketball touched the beetle the player would know they lost and start over </li>
			<li> Sensing - I used the key ____ pressed block inside the if statement many times in my project so that the bug could move and if the beetle touched a basketball the game would stop and start over </li>
			<li> Data - I used variables in my game to keep track of the score and level and to time how long the player was playing </li>
