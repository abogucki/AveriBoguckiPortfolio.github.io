			Description: In this project, I used Scratch to design and create a program that displays my name. The requirements were to add a sprite for each letter in my name and then give them three cool behaviors. The program needed to start when the green flag was clicked and for extra credit I added a function to reset the screen to the beginning each time the green flag was clicked.
		</p>
		
		<h4> Concepts Learned </h4>
		
		<ul>
			<li> Events -  I used the green flag clicked and when space key pressed event blocks to change the costumes of the letters and have the fish start moving </li>
			<li> Looks - I used the change costume betton for the letter sprites so they would change when the green flag was clicked or the space key was pressed </li>
			<li> Sprites - I used the library of sprites to find letters in my name and adjusted the costumes when the space key or green flag were pressed </li>
			<li> Control - I used a forever block to continually make the fish move until the green flag was pressed </li>
			<li> Movement - I used the x and y values to make my sprites move to their original location when the green flag was clicked and I rotated the B sprite 15 degrees forever and then straighten it after the green flag was clicked using a movement button </li>
		</ul>

			Description: In this project, I used Scratch to design and create a program that displayed my choice of computer that was perfect for an 11th grader. The requirements were to present 4 computers, and then chose the best one based on what the 11th grader needed in her/his computer. The program started when the green flag was clicked.
		</p>
		
		<h4> Concepts Learned </h4>
		
		<ul>
			<li> Events - I used the when the green flag is clicked and when the right arrow key is pressed block to go to the next slide/start the presentation </li>
			<li> Looks - I used the switch costume block and the show and hide blocks to program the sprites in the presentation to appear and disappear </li>
			<li> Sprites - I used the the library of sprites to decorate the presentation and make it look nice </li>
			<li> Control - I used a forever block on one of the sprites to make it change costumes constantly </li>
		<ul>

			Description: In this project, I used Scratch to design and create a game where the player has to make the bug dodge all the basketballs that are rolling towards it. The requirements were to let the player know they won, keep score, have a timer, have a help screen with directions, have the game reset when itâ€™s over, and have the game get harder as the player keeps playing. The program starts when the green flag is clicked.
