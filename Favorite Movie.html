		<h2> Why I Like This Movie </h2>
		
		<p>
		I think this movie was amazing because of it's immense suspense and the hilarious characters. The viewer is left astonished with an ending they never saw coming. There is also a good amount of action as well. All in all, this movie is one of the best I have ever seen!

		<h2> Favorite Actor </h2>
		My favorite actor in this movie was Morgan Freeman because his character was very condescending and determined to catch the Horsemen.
