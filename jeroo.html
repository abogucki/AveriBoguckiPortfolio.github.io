		<h3> Unit 1 </h3>
		<p>		
			In this Jeroo unit, I became familiar with the Jeroo environment. I used simple Jeroo actions to solve the labs. This unit is when I started to become familiar with Jeroo and begin to use all the controls.
		</p>
		
		<h4> Concepts Learned </h4>
		
		<ul>
			<li> I learned more about objects, like flowers and nets </li>
			<li>I also learned how to analyze a problem and determine the methods needed to solve it </li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>

		<h3> Unit 2 </h3>
		<p>
			In this Jeroo unit, I now knew how to use Jeroo actions to solve a problem. However, this unit also introduced me to Jeroo methods so I wouldn't have to repeat single actions over and over again. Precision was a key element for these methods. This unit is the unit where I started learning more complicated methods involving the Jeroos.
		</p>
		
		<h4> Concepts Learned </h4>
		<ul>
			<li> I learned how to use method calls to solve problems </li>
			<li> I also learned that I must get comfortable with single Jeroo methods being called multiple times in solving problems that involve the same actions being repeated </li>
			<li> These labs require precision in making sure the Jeroos accomplish their assigned job </li>
		</ul>

		<h3> Unit 3 </h3>
		<p>
			In this Jeroo unit, I now knew how to use simple Jeroo methods to solve a problem. This unit was all about planning out a method to solve the problem with precision and accuracy. You must always meet the pre and post conditions. By the end of this unit I knew how to do more complicated Jeroo methods and solve more complicated problems.
		</p>
		
		<h4> Concepts Learned </h4>
		
		<ul>
			<li> I learned how to analyze a problem and determine how to break it into smaller tasks and then create the needed methods to solve it </li>
			<li> I also learned that I must plan each method based on preconditions as well as post conditions </li>
		<ul>
			
		<p>
			Below are screenshots of the Lockup lab and the Pinball lab.

		</p>
		
		</br>
		
		<h3> Unit 4 </h3>
		<p>
			In this Jeroo unit, I now knew how to solve more difficult problems with more difficult Jeroo methods. I solved labs by analyzing the problem and then creating multiple methods to come up with a solution. I had to create commands so I could fulfill all of the conditions of the problem.
		</p>
		
		<h4> Concepts Learned </h4>
		
		<ul>
			<li>I learned how to analyze a problem and involve branching and decision making in creating a solution for the problem </li>
			<li> I also learned that I must always create commands based on the various requirements of a problem </li>
		</ul>
